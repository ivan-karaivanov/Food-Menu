# Food Menu App

This Food Menu application is a web-based menu showcasing a delightful selection of dishes. This application is built using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, offering a variety of culinary options, including pancakes, cupcakes, hummus, hamburgers, salmon, and vegetables.

## Usage

The script.js file adds interactivity to the application. It includes two main functionalities:

1. Toggle Menu Animation: When a user clicks on an element with the class menu, this script toggles the change class on all elements with the class target. This creates an animated effect, likely for displaying or hiding a menu.

2. Automatic Icon Rotation: This part of the script automatically rotates through a set of icons. It selects the icons within the .section-1-icons element and applies the change class to them sequentially, creating a rotating or slideshow-like effect. The rotation occurs at a regular interval, approximately every 4 seconds.

These JavaScript functionalities enhance the user experience within the application, making it visually appealing and interactive. Users can click to toggle the menu and enjoy a dynamic icon display
